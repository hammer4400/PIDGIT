Simulation of controlling the temperature of a room using PID controller for the heater output.

Part of my bachelor thesis project (PID in Smart Buildings). 

The simulations are implemented in MATLAB using Simulink.

# Description

Different simulations are implemented, and in each one of them the parameters are configured in the .m files, and simulated in the Simulink environment.

A cost model is also provided in one of the files.

Details can be found in the pdf file "Details of the simulation".

# Model.m

Estimates the parameters of the system, according to the thermodynamic model described in the pdf file "Details of the simulation".

# roomsim_data.m

Similar estimation as Model.m but for the other thermodynamic model described in the pdf file "Details of the simulation".

# Rest of the files

Check the corresponding .m and simulink files in their folders.
